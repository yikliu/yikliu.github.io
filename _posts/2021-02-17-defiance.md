I guess everybody gets bored at some point. 

For years I've been trying to avoid the hard conversation of aging and being pushed out. As it turns out, the very thing you are trying to escape from will always catch up with you. Now it's me being caught up. 

However, I'm still defiant. 

I truly believe there is still bit of fire inside me. There is still hope for good things to come. For me, personally. But I have to go out and get it. It's not going to come to my door. 

So I decided to be more proactive. Be more open minded and greedy. Greedy for more time and more for myself. Be greedy about things to learn and absorb. 

I decided to continue with this documentation tool of my thoughts and life. Just keep experimenting with ideas and fresh ways of life. 

I'm still not done.
